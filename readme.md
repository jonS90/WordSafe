This project is unstable, volatile, and subject to much change at any moment.

WordSafe is a simple cammand line utility that makes it quick and easy to
create, read, and edit encrypted text files.

- Pretty user input prompts thanks to [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
- Delightfully self-documented CLI thanks to [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs).

# Install

```
npm install -g jonsmithers/WordSafe#node
```

This will also upgrade WordSafe if it's already installed.
